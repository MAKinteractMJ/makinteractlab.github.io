    <strong>I am a maker</strong> interested in creating tools to help other makers better building prototypes or learning new technical skills. I am specifically interested in <strong>tools for electronics and physical computing, fabrication, and mechanical systems for body augmentation</strong>. I also develop tangible and wearable interfaces for enhancing and altering sensory perception and input capabilities, such as <i>haptic controllers and smart-wearables</i>.

## Short Bio
Andrea received his [Ph.D. from KAIST](https://ct.kaist.ac.kr/main.php?lang=2) in 2012, his Master's in Computer Science from [NYU](http://www.nyu.edu) and his Laurea (BSc+MS) in business administration from [Bocconi University](https://www.unibocconi.eu/wps/wcm/connect/bocconi/sitopubblico_en/navigation+tree/home). Before joining KAIST, he worked at [Sungkyunkwan University](www.skku.edu/eng/index.do) as faculty member in the department of Computer Science, and as a video game programmer for a New York startup after earning his Master's degree. I have an _Erdős number_ of 3, and I collect [eyeglasses](https://alsoplantsfly.com/images/pictures/profile/glasses.jpg).
